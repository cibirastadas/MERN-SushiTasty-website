# Website SushiTasty

Created an online store using the **Node.js** platform and the **Express.js** framework for the server part. Client-side used the **React.js** framework to manage dynamic content and apply the site for mobile devices. On the website where you can read feedbacks, see products, log in to systems, leave feedback, get a response from the system administrator. Also im storing "cookies" about user that is log in. This helps remember user and thus speeding up login to the site.
